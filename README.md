Performant, productive & progressive AngularJS seed

## Guiding Principles

Here's the direction of this repo:

1. **Performant**: Fast & easy are the driving principles. Nomatter how elegant, a web app that is slow or complicated is a liability, not an asset.
2. **Productive**: Clean & readable code. Well-structured & well-instrumented ecosystem. These are key ingredients to gracefully grow into a large codebase that is easy to grok & develop.
3. **Progressive**: Written in ES6, AngularJS 2 ready & component-based. _"Skate to where the puck is going, not where it's been."_
